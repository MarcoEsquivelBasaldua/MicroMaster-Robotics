# Generating Random Rotation Matrices

This code generates a random rotation matrix and plots another random vector before and after being rotated by this matrix. The $x$, $y$ and $z$ axis are plot in red, green and blue respectively, following the convention in the robotics comunity. Additional features in the code:
- Generate a random matrix $R$ that satisfy the requirements for rotation matrices.
- Apply the rotation represented by the rotation matrix $R$ randomly generated to the vector $u$ and call the new rotated vector $v$.
