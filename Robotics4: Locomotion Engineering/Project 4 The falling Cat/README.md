# The Cat with Nine Lives

It is said that a cat always lands on its feet. This is mostly due to its flexible body (spine and tail) that allows it to change its orientation by twisting while falling. Let us make a simplified simulation of the reorientation of the falling cat considering only the sagittal plane dynamics. Assume that our cat has a stiff spine and can only move its tail, (i.e it has a rigid body part and a tail part). The body is rigid with mass $m_b$ and moment of inertia $I_b$ around the center of mass. The tail is a point mass $m_t$ that is $I_t$ from the tail joint. The weight of the tail component of the cat is relatively small to the weight of the rest of the body, yet this cat has an extremely long tail.  We will assume the the center of mass is located at the tail joint for easier modeling, and the height of the center of mass is $y$. The torque applied at the tail through the tail joint is $\tau$.
